🚗 US Accidents Analysis – EDA & ML Project
A comprehensive data science project that explores and models over 4 million real-world traffic accidents across the United States. This project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a machine learning pipeline to predict accident severity, uncover insights, and build a publish-ready portfolio project.

📂 Project Overview
Section	Description
📊 EDA	Identify trends by time, location, weather, and more
🧠 ML Modeling	Predict accident severity (1–4) using classification models
🗺️ Visuals	Create impactful heatmaps, bar plots, and time charts
💾 Dataset	4.2M+ US accident records from 2016–2021 (Kaggle)
🛠️ Tools	Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

📌 Dataset Info
📍 Source: US Accidents (Kaggle)

🧾 Rows: 4.2 Million+

⚙️ Columns: Location, Time, Weather, Road Conditions, Severity (Target)

🔍 EDA Objectives
Find the top states/cities with the most accidents

Time-based patterns (hour of day, day of week, month)

Severity breakdowns by condition

Impact of weather and visibility

Visual storytelling with heatmaps & line plots

🤖 Machine Learning (Planned)
Target: Severity (1: Least, 4: Most Severe)

Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Steps: Preprocessing → Feature Selection → Training → Evaluation
